    jj_comment: "I've never seen a description of this series that would make me want to read it, so I'll try to sum it up myself. \n\n Assorted Crisis Events is an anthology of standalone stories that explore contemporary issues through the lens of speculative fiction. Its topics include climate change, the experience of immigrants in the US, disability, the mishandling of childhood trauma, and more. Each story is distinct but they all share a sense of deep empathy. \n\n This is some of the most powerful, insightful social-political commentary I've seen in comics. Deniz Camp is doing great work here.",
